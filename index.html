                <p>The current covid 19 pandemic has only intensified a major fault line in our contemporary world.
                    While the present situation has exposed the inadequacy of our institutions – the home, institutions
                    related to governance, production, learning, leisure, and has rendered the street a dangerous place,
                    it seems like this crisis was already in the making. Our lives were getting increasingly fragmented,
                    at the same time ironically increasingly networked. The utopia of the public that had fired
                    architectural imagination post-independence was already splintering into privatopias of hedonism,
                    with the state taking a back seat. At the same time, we were seeing new ecologies of learning
                    emerging outside the university, new forms of co-living and co-working, new agile forms of
                    production and new forms of leisure. The street had intensified its use from being choked by traffic
                    on the one hand to becoming a home for the city’s many migrants. These are no longer the homogenous
                    modern publics of civil society but multiple collectives that are agile and shapeshifting. It seems
                    like it is these collectives that will be able to salvage our otherwise splintering futures. The
                    question we ask is, ‘what is the architecture of these collectives?’ What new spaces do they occupy?
                    What are our new forms of home and living? What new institutions have we evolved? What are our new
                    spaces of production, of learning, leisure and the street? And what are the new futures of these
                    collectives, that promise to tide us through?

                    What is the architecture of future collectives?

                    The future of home and living
                    The future of learning
                    The future of institutions
                    The future of production
                    The future of leisure
                    The future of the street
